# Pulse Application - Development Progress

## Feature 1: Foundation & Environment [COMPLETE]
**Completed:** 2026-01-16

### Implementation Details:
- ✅ Installed Hono framework (v4.11.4)
- ✅ Created Worker project structure (src/index.ts)
- ✅ Configured wrangler.toml for Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ Implemented health-check endpoint (GET /status)
- ✅ Validated local development server stability
- ✅ Added npm scripts (dev, deploy)

### Validation Results:
- Development server running on http://127.0.0.1:8787
- GET /status endpoint returns:
  - Status: 200 OK
  - Response: {"status":"ok","message":"Pulse application is running","timestamp":"..."}

## Feature 2: Persistent Storage Layer (D1 & R2) [COMPLETE]
**Completed:** 2026-01-17

### Implementation Details:
- ✅ Provisioned D1 database `pulse_db` (ID: 03bb0256-0c26-4776-870d-beefcf18916f)
- ✅ Provisioned R2 bucket `pulse-images`
- ✅ Updated wrangler.toml with D1 and R2 bindings
- ✅ Created database migration (0001_create_feedback_table.sql)
- ✅ Defined feedback table schema (id, source, content, sentiment, urgency, image_key, timestamp)
- ✅ Added indexes on urgency and timestamp for optimized queries
- ✅ Applied migrations to both local and remote databases
- ✅ Installed @cloudflare/workers-types package
- ✅ Created tsconfig.json for TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Updated TypeScript bindings (DB: D1Database, IMAGES: R2Bucket)

### Validation Results:
- Development server running with bindings: DB (pulse_db), IMAGES (pulse-images)
- GET /test/db endpoint:
  - Status: 200 OK
  - Successfully inserted test record to D1
  - Successfully retrieved record from D1
  - Response: {"status":"ok","message":"D1 Database connection successful","recordCount":1,...}
- GET /test/r2 endpoint:
  - Status: 200 OK
  - Successfully uploaded test file to R2
  - Successfully retrieved file from R2
  - Content match: true
  - Response: {"status":"ok","message":"R2 Storage connection successful",...}

### Architecture:
- Structured metadata stored in D1 SQL Database (fast queries)
- Binary files (screenshots) stored in R2 Object Storage (scalable)
- Separation ensures database remains performant

## Feature 3: Intelligence Layer (Workers AI) [COMPLETE]
**Completed:** 2026-01-17

### Implementation Details:
- ✅ Updated PRD to document 1-5 urgency scale (approved change)
- ✅ Added Workers AI binding to wrangler.toml (`[ai] binding = "AI"`)
- ✅ Updated TypeScript bindings (AI: Ai)
- ✅ Created `classifyFeedback()` function using Llama 3.1-8b-instruct
- ✅ Designed comprehensive prompt with 1-5 urgency scale definitions
- ✅ Implemented JSON parsing from AI response
- ✅ Created test endpoint with 4 test cases

### AI Classification Logic:
- **Model:** @cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct (Native Workers AI)
- **Input:** Customer feedback text
- **Output:** `{ sentiment: "positive|neutral|negative", urgency: 1-5 }`
- **Urgency Scale:**
  - 1 = Low priority (compliments, minor suggestions)
  - 2 = Normal (standard feedback, feature requests)
  - 3 = Medium (usability issues, moderate bugs)
  - 4 = High (significant problems affecting user experience)
  - 5 = Critical (crashes, data loss, security issues)

### Validation Results:
- Development server running with AI binding (remote mode)
- GET /test/ai endpoint:
  - Status: 200 OK
  - Successfully classified 4 test cases
  - Test 1: "App crashes" → Correctly identified as critical
  - Test 2: "Love the design" → Correctly identified as low priority
  - Test 3: "Button misalignment" → Correctly identified as low/medium
  - Test 4: "Slow loading" → Correctly identified as high priority
  - Response: {"status":"ok","message":"Workers AI classification successful",...}

### Next Feature:
Feature 4: Ingestion Pipeline (Webhook Logic) - Awaiting approval to proceed
